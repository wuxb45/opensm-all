opensm-all starts an opensm instance for each individual IB port. It simplifies the configuration when you have multiple IB subnets. It works with zero configuration.

This is an independent package that should be installed together with [opensm].
To use opensm-all, you should disable opensm.service, and enable opensm-all.service.
